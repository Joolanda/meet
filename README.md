## About

Meet application is a progressive web application (by create-react-app) that uses Google Calender API and a serverless backend with AWS Lambda. . It fetches events from the API so users can view a list of upcoming events. 

See the **hosted project** [here](https://joolanda.github.io/meet/). <br />

For this project I was using a test driven development(TDD )approach with Enzyme and Jest.
Translated user stories into scenarios for unit testing, acceptance testing, and end-to-end testing

I am currently updating this READMe file - there will be more filling very soon!
