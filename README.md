## About

Meet application is a progressive web application (by create-react-app) that uses Google Calender API and a serverless backend with AWS Lambda. . It fetches events from the API so users can view a list of upcoming events. 

See the **hosted project** [here](https://joolanda.github.io/meet/). <br />

For this project I was using a test driven development(TDD - writing tests first, code later) approach with Enzyme and Jest.
Translated user stories into scenarios for unit testing, acceptance testing, and end-to-end testing

Technologies used: 

## Key features

- Allows users to filter events by city
- Users can show and hide event details
- Users can specify the number of events they see displayed
- Allows users to use the app when offline
- Add an app shortcut to the homescreen
- View a chart showing the number of upcoming events by city
